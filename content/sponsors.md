The GBCC2025 conference, aims to bridge the gap in integrating genomic data, tools, and communities. With the rapid advancements in genomic science generating an ever-increasing volume of data and analysis methods, there is a critical need for robust, accessible tools and collaborative platforms to facilitate data analysis and interpretation. Despite significant progress, substantial gaps remain in fostering environments where new analysis methods are readily developed, incorporated, and utilized, hindering the ability to achieve medical breakthroughs that improve human health.

Galaxy's user-friendly web platform and Bioconductor's comprehensive suite of R-based genomic data analysis tools offer complementary strengths that, when combined, provide powerful, unified solutions for the genomic research community. This joint conference will enhance interoperability, promote innovative workflows, improve training and education, enrich documentation efforts, and ultimately accelerate discoveries in genomic science.

We are offering several sponsorship levels designed to provide excellent exposure and engagement opportunities. By sponsoring our event, you will gain visibility among over 300+ influential community members, including faculty, investigators, students, postdocs, developers and platform users. Your support will not only enhance your brand's reputation but also demonstrate your commitment to social responsibility and community development.
